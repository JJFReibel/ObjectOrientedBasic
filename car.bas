Cls
REM OOP really cannot be done in BASIC, as the original version is
REM even more primitive than Pascal, but we can use an array to
REM define a primitive pseudo-class, and allow another array
REM to be created as a copy of the previous array, in effect using
REM the original array as a base class to define an object
REM using C to represent car. Although car can be used in more
REM recent versions of BASIC, the original Dartmouth BASIC only
REM permitted arrays to be named with single letters A-Z
REM and were only permitted to hold up to 10 elements unless
REM the DIM keyword was prefixed. Subscripts were 1-10 in Version 1
REM subscripts were changed to 0-9 in Version 2
REM Version 1: s[1]=4
REM Version 2: s[0]=4
REM Arrays would contain integers, floats, or strings
REM It is generally considered bad programming practice in the modern
REM era to name variables with C, because most code today runs atop
REM C and C++ programs, which have the letter C as a reserved
REM character
REM As a last thing to note, the ability to define functions in BASIC
REM was not added until Version 4, using the keyword DEF

ARRAY C
C[1] = 0
C[2] = 0
C[3] = 0

PRINT "Creating car."
ARRAY S
S = C
S[1] = 4
S[2] = 4
S[3] = 4
PRINT "Wheel check: " + S[1]
PRINT "Door check: " + S[2]
PRINT "Cylinder check: " + S[3]
PRINT ""

PRINT "Adding wheel directly to car object."
S[1] = 5
PRINT "Wheel check: " + S[1]
PRINT "Door check: " + S[2]
PRINT "Cylinder check: " + S[3]
PRINT ""

PRINT "Removing wheel directly from car object."
S[1] = S[1] - 1
PRINT "Wheel check: " + S[1]
PRINT "Door check: " + S[2]
PRINT "Cylinder check: " + S[3]
PRINT ""
